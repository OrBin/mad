#About
I have 0 idea if this works in practice. 

Inspirations taken from bits and pieces of psychology studies and my own lazy-ass intuitions. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength-ebook/dp/B0052REQCY">Related : Baumeister's work.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfYv3IEOqM">Insightful Daniel Golemann Vid</a>

Previously tried using extensions that prevent distractions by fully blocking or restricting site usage (e.g. StayFocusd). Worked in the short term, but I would eventually just remove them out of inconvenience.

The goal is to aid the rewiring of wanting long-term goals (short-term happiness has value). Fun 'human-capital development' focused web browsing links are given as alternative browsing.


#Developer Diary
Monitoring my process. Started at HackWestern. <br>
v0.1 29/03/2015
- Knowledge basis: code academy javascript, stack overflow, github files of other chrome extensions, chrome extension api and docs.
- Heavily inspired by other anti distraction extensions, e.g. StayFocusd or ColdTurkey.
- Wanted to manipulate myself into not being distracted, by criticizing and causing cognitive dissonance.
- Knowledge gained: Negative, or annoyingly long to type guilt messages are draining. Hard to be productive when you're feeling shitty. Going to try to use inspiring, or user-empowering quotes that also make you think, but aren't depressing amongst other additional features in next vers.

v0.1.0.3 30/03/2015
- Changed UI so the alternatives are upfront, more immediate and relatively bigger. Intuitively that should be the focus, not the typing to unlock/go to the website.
- Learned a bit more jquery syntax. It's much nicer for manipulating html elements =D.
- The more positive focused thoughts seem better for now... Blind optimism doesn't seem appropriate here though.
