Mindfulness Anti Distraction / Cognitive Dissonance Anti Distraction

Chrome extension to help curtail bad habitual distractions.

I have 0 idea if this works in practice. 

Inspirations taken from bits and pieces of psychology studies and my own lazy-ass intuitions. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength-ebook/dp/B0052REQCY">Related slightly: Baumeister's work</a>. 

Previously tried using extensions that prevent distractions by fully blocking or restricting site usage (e.g. StayFocusd). Worked in the short term, but I would eventually just remove them out of inconvenience.

The goal is to aid the rewiring of wanting long-term goals (short-term happiness has value). Fun 'human-capital development' focused web browsing links are given as alternative browsing.
