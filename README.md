#About
I have 0 idea if this works in practice. 

Inspirations taken from bits and pieces of psychology studies and my own lazy-ass intuitions. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength-ebook/dp/B0052REQCY">Related : Baumeister's work.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfYv3IEOqM">Insightful Daniel Golemann Vid</a>

Previously tried using extensions that prevent distractions by fully blocking or restricting site usage (e.g. StayFocusd). Worked in the short term, but I would eventually just remove them out of inconvenience.

The goal is to aid the rewiring of wanting long-term goals (short-term happiness has value). Fun 'human-capital development' focused web browsing links are given as alternative browsing.


#Developer Diary
Monitoring my process. Started at HackWestern. <br>

- Knowledge basis: code academy javascript, stack overflow, github files of other chrome extensions, chrome extension api and docs.
- Heavily inspired by other anti distraction extensions, e.g. StayFocusd or ColdTurkey. Meant to be an alternative long term method to ween one self from short term reward systems. 
- Knowledge gained: Negative, or annoyingly long to type guilt messages are draining. Hard to be productive when you're feeling shitty. Going to try to use inspiring, or user-empowering quotes that also make you think, but aren't depressing amongst other additional features in next vers.
